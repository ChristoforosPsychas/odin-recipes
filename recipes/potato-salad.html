    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Potatoes</strong>: It's not potato salad without potatoes. The recipe doesn't specify what size potatoes or what kind, so choose medium-size potatoes, or enough to serve eight. (5 potatoes)</li>
            <li><strong>Eggs</strong>: Hard-boiled eggs are a must-have for this kind of old-fashioned potato salad, but you can leave them out if you really want to.(3 eggs)</li>
            <li><strong>Celery</strong>: Celery adds a crunchy element to balance the softer texture and creaminess of the potatoes.(1 cup chopped celery)</li>
            <li><strong>Onion</strong>: You can use any onion you like, including yellow, white, or red onions. Chop the onion into small, uniform pieces so no one bites into a big chunk of raw onion.(½ cup chopped onion)</li>
            <li><strong>Relish</strong>: Use your favorite sweet pickle relish. Some reviewers chopped up sweet gherkin pickles, or substitute relish or pickles that are less sweet.(½ cup sweet pickle relish)</li>
            <li><strong>Mayonnaise</strong>: This is the creamy element that brings all the ingredients together. For best results, mix the mayonnaise, mustard, relish, and seasonings together in a separate bowl. Give it a taste test and adjust the seasonings before adding to the potatoes, eggs, and onion.(¼ cup mayonnaise)</li>
            <li><strong>Mustard</strong>: Use your favorite mustard. Some reviewers like to use yellow mustard and some prefer Dijon.(1 tablespoon prepared mustard)</li>
            <li><strong>Seasonings</strong>: This recipe calls for garlic salt, celery salt, and ground black pepper to taste; some reviewers added extras like paprika and garlic powder. You can add minced herbs, too, like dill, chives, parsley, and tarragon. (¼ teaspoon garlic salt, ¼ teaspoon celery salt, ground black pepper to taste)</li>
        </ul>
